      Oskar Schindler is a vain and greedy German businessman who becomes an
      unlikely humanitarian amid the barbaric German Nazi reign when he feels
      compelled to turn his factory into a refuge for Jews. Based on the true
      story of Oskar Schindler who managed to save about 1100 Jews from being
      gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, it is a testament to the good
      in all of us.
